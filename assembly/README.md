# Assembly Sandbox #
The aim of this repository is to contain my assembly sandbox and my little experiments.
The little programs I write here are supposed to run on Intel's x86-64 CPUs.

## How to start? ##
Start by installing nasm and gdb
```
sudo apt-get install nasm
```
and
```
sudo apt-get install libc6-dbg gdb
```

Then make a copy of newSandbox.asm to make sure you don't mess with the original sandbox.
Now you can play around and debug your assembly programs!

## Experiments ##
The folder *experiments* contains the programs I might need to get back to while learning.
